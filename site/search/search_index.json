Should be LVCMOS25 (0-2.5V) with width 10-100 ns. Waveforms : Analog signal to be digitized. Should be LVCMOS25 (0-2.5V). Max width is 1984 nanoseconds by default, but this depends on the sampling rate (default 1Gsps). HDSoC : Digitization board that handles inputs across multiple channels. Can be set to trigger on external or internal (self) signals. Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA : Acts as a parent board to the HDSoC. Handles 1GbE communication and firmware storage among other things. Desktop : Receives and processes events that are effectively streamed from the digitization system. Labled Picture 1GbE NIC (Gigabit Ethernet Network Interface Card) Overview These NICs are generally PCIe Cards that are \"plug and play\". They provide a 1 gigabit per second ethernet connection for the host computer. Configuration If you machine has a GUI, you may find it easier to edit network settings that way. Otherwise, you can edit settings from command line. For example for UKY's teststand we use: nmcli connection modify enp3s0 \\ ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.1/24 \\ ipv4.method manual \\ connection.autoconnect yes \\ ipv6.method ignore You may need to create a connection configuration file first if it doesn't exist. For example for UKY's teststand we use: nmcli connection add type ethernet con-name enp3s0 ifname enp3s0 In particular, the ipv4.addresses is important. Here the port is specified to accept any traffic on the 192.168.1.xxx subnet. See the networking page for more details. Nexys A7 Video Card Overview The Nexys A7 is a versatile and high-performance FPGA development board from Digilent, featuring the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. It is like the \"mother board\" for the HDSoC. For this use case it will provide power, an interface to update firmware, and an interface for data transfer. You can read more about this board on diligent's Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA page . FMCs HDSoC The HDSoC (or other nalu board) connects to the FPGA board via an FMC connector. See HDSoCv1 rev 2 for more info. Wired Connections USB A to microUSB A USB A to microUSB can be used for UART communication. This can be used for data transfer via UART (very slow, limited to ~100 KB/s) and uploading firmware to the board. See the hardware diagram for port locations. 1GbE Connection Connect an ethernet cable between the board and a host desktop computer. Most modern ethernet cables should work. See the hardware diagram for port locations. Configuration To congfigure the board, the appropriate firmware must be uploaded to it. This can be retrieved from nalu scientific's board downloads page . There are several options, the easiest two are: Use microSD card with loaded firmware (see HDSoC quickstart guide ) Upload the firmware via Vivado Steps to complete step 2 are below. Downloading the firmware Navigate to Nalu Scientific's support website . Go to the page for the HDSoCv1-evalr2 (or appropriate board). Download the most recent firmware version. This DAQ has been tested with firmware version 938. The file should be something like HDSoC_eval_v938.bit . Downloading Vivado Note: Vivado may take a long time to install because it is a very large program. This step could take serveral hours. A full Vivado installation can be around 200 GB. Below is a \"minimal\" installation that is ~50GB The easiest way to upload firmware to the board is via Vivado. Download the most recent version of Vivado for your system from Xilinx's download page . You will need to make an account with AMD to install. This is easiest on a machine with a GUI. For a simple install follow these steps: Run installer. On linux run the bin file with /path/to/.../installer.bin . On the welcome page, hit next Enter credentials, download and install now, hit next Under products to install select Vivado, hit next For customizing the installation. Under \"Design Tools\" select only \"Vivado Design Suite\" Under \"Devices\" select only \"Production Devices\">\"7 Series\" Under \"Installation Options\", make sure you have \"Install Cable Drivers\" selected. Hit next. Agree to License agreements, hit next. Select which directory to install to. Hit next. Begin installation. Uploading Firmware Once Vivado is installed run it. On linux you may need to source the settings file with source /path/to/.../Xilinx/Vivado/202x.x/settings64.sh , then you can run the command vivado to launch vivado. A new project needs to be created. This can be a \"dummy\" project since we're just uploading firmware. Step 1 of this guide gives all the details needed to creatae new project. To load firmware onto the Nexys A7 using Vivado, plug the USB A to microUSB connection into the program port of the Nexys A7 board. See the hardware diagram for port locations. Follow these steps to upload firmware such that it persists when the board reboots: Open Vivado Hardware Manager and Connect to the Board Open Vivado and go to Tools > Hardware Manager . Hardware Manager should also be visible on the left sidebar of the project page. In the Hardware Manager window, click Open Target and select Auto Connect or choose the appropriate JTAG or USB connection to connect to your board. If the board is connected properly, Vivado should automatically detect it. Convert the Bitstream to a Binary File To program the flash, you need to convert the bitstream to a binary file. Nalu provides a .bit files, but we can convert the .bit file into a .bin file. Here\u2019s how you can do it: After the bitstream is generated, open a the TCL Console ( Window > Tcl Console ) and use the following command to generate the .bin file from the .bit file: bash write_flash -force -file /path/to/output/firmware.bin -bitstream /path/to/input/firmware.bit Replace the paths with the appropriate file locations for your system. Example: bash write_flash -force -file /home/pioneer/vivado_stuff/Nexsys_Video_A7_For_HDSoc/HDSoC_eval_v938.bin -bitstream /home/pioneer/vivado_stuff/Nexsys_Video_A7_For_HDSoc/HDSoC_eval_v938.bit Add Configuration Memory Device Once the .bin file is ready, go back to the Hardware Manager in Vivado and: Right-click on your connected device in the Devices pane (in the Hardware Manager). Click Add Configuration Memory Device . In the dialog box, select the appropriate part for your flash device. For the Nexys A7, the part number will likely be something like S25FL256Sxxxxxx0-SPI-x1_x2_x4 . Click OK to confirm. Program the Flash Memory After selecting the configuration memory device: Vivado will prompt you to program the flash memory . Select the firmware .bin file you generated earlier. Click Program to start the flashing process. The process will take some time depending on the size of your firmware file and the connection speed. Power Cycle the Device After programming is complete, power down the device and power it back on. Once powered on, you should see indicators (such as green lights on the HDSoC board) signaling that the firmware has been loaded successfully. HDSoCv1 rev 2 Overview The HDSoC is a high density digitizer system on a chip evaluation board. It provides a flexible digitization system. The high density part makes it appealing to for use in the ATAR DAQ, as the ATAR will have thousands of channels. You can read more in the HDSoC product sheet or on Nalu Scientific's HDSoC page . Wired Connections MMCX connector The HDSoC's inputs (channel inputs and external trigger) and outputs (external trigger output) use a MMCX connectors. See the labeled picture and conceptual diagram to see where these inputs are on the board. Configuration See the HDSoC quickstart guide . You don't need to worry about using the SD card to boot the firmware if you've already uploaded it.","title":"Hardware Overview"},{"location":"hardware/#hardware","text":"","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#general-hardware-overview","text":"","title":"General Hardware Overview"},{"location":"hardware/#conceptual-diagram","text":"Trigger Signal : An external signal to tell the board when to digitize the input waveforms.

Installation Guide Install any needed packages with pip. Two that are needed are: pip install pybind11 naludaq ROOT Overview ROOT is an open-source data analysis framework developed by CERN. It is widely used in high-energy physics for data processing, statistical analysis, visualization, and storage. It is needed for some features of Midas. Installation Guide General installaiton guides are provided by ROOT at their Installing ROOT and Building ROOT from source pages. Using yum Package Manager 1 Enable the EPEL repository : sudo yum install epel-release 2 Download and Install ROOT : sudo yum install root Building from source 1 Example building latest stable branch from source git clone --branch latest-stable --depth=1 https://github.com/root-project/root.git root_src mkdir root_build root_install && cd root_build cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../root_install ../root_src # && check cmake configuration output for warnings or errors cmake --build . -- install -j4 # if you have 4 cores available for compilation source ../root_install/bin/thisroot.sh # or thisroot.{fish,csh} Note : Adjust the ROOT version and the download URL as needed. Always check for the latest version on the official ROOT website . Furthermore, if you are not building from source you are installing precompiled binaries, which may not be up to date versions of ROOT. For specific versions, you may need to build root from source. Midas Overview Midas is a data acquisition system used in high-energy physics experiments. Midas provides the following functionalities: Run control Experiment configuration Data readout Event building Data storage Slow control Alarm systems ... much more ... Installation Guide For a general Midas installation, you can follow this Linux Quick Start Guide . For the g-2 modified DAQ, we use a custom version of midas, which can be cloned and installed as follows: 1 Set experiment name environment variable export MIDAS_EXPT_NAME=DAQ 2 Create exptab file mkdir online cd online touch exptab echo \"$MIDAS_EXPT_NAME $(pwd) system\" >> exptab export MIDAS_EXPTAB=$(pwd)/exptab 3 Install Midas cd .. mkdir packages git clone --recursive git@github.com:PIONEER-Experiment/midas-modified.git midas cd midas mkdir build cd build cmake .. make -j$(nproc) install cd .. 4 Set MIDASSYS environment variable and add to path export MIDASSYS=$(pwd) export PATH=$PATH:$MIDASSYS/bin Note : you can hardcode the environment variables MIDASSYS (and add to path), MIDAS_EXPTAB , and MIDAS_EXPT_NAME by adding the appropriate commands to your .bashrc file. This way, the environment variables are set with each new terminal session for that user. 5 (Optional) it is recommended to also install the midas python package : pip install -e $MIDASSYS/python --user Nalu Board Controller Overview The Nalu Board Controller library is a C++ library that uses pybind to wrap around some existing naludaq python methods. It allows the midas frontend to use C++ methods to configure nalu scientific's boards. You can read more in on the github page for this library . Installation Guide This should be automatically installed when installing the ATAR DAQ midas frontend . If you want to manually install, see the installation guide on the github's readme . Nalu Event Collector Overview The Nalu Event Collector library is a C++ library that handles event collection from a nalu scientific board at high data rates. It has been internally tested to handle data rates as high as 300 MB/s. The HDSoCv1 board can send at most ~55 MB/s (due to an internal hardware limit), so this software handles virtually all uses cases. The library can automatically handle collecting UDP packets from a nalu scientific board, parsing them, and collecting them into events. The library holds a buffer of these events that midas can pull from to form its own events. You can read more in on the github page for this library . Installation Guide This should be automatically installed when installing the ATAR DAQ midas frontend . If you want to manually install, see the installation guide on the github's readme . reflect-cpp Overview Reflect-cpp is a C++ library that achieves some level of reflection in C++. For our use case, we just use it to convert C++ structs to json and json to C++ structs. This removes a lot of boiler plate code that would otherwise go into the ODB management.
